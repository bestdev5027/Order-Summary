#Order summary card component solution using html and css...

|I am just getting familiar with programming and not a fast learner, a lil bit slow in learning but I have set up a target for myself which I believe is one of the best way of learning.|


|I knew my solution might not be the best because on this project, I did a lot of test and run by guessing in which 70/100 of my testing has always been correct most especially the flex part in styling but I know with a lot of practices, I will get the best out of it...|

|Feedbacks are appreciated...
Thanks|
